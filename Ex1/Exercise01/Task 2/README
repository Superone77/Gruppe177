### Task 2

1. 
Row 16: a = 0
Row 17: a = 123
Row 18: a = 42
Row 19: a = 42
Row 20: a = 84
Row 21: a = 84
Row 22: a = 42
Row 23: a = 42
Row 24: a = 42
Row 25: a = 42
Row 26: a = 42


2.
Errors are in row 23~26.

a. The 24. row: array2 do not need free().   because array2 in stack. And malloc() allocate dynamic memory from heap to array1
so it need free().

b. And we can not use array1 after free array1, because the memory has been free.

c. The 25. row: array2 is a pointer, it save a value, which is the address of array. so array2 = 321 means change this
value to 321.
