### Task 2

1. a = 0

2.
Errors are in row 23~26.

a. The 24. row: array2 do not need free().   because array in stack. And malloc() allocate dynamic memory from heap to array1
so it need free().

b. And we can not use array1 after free array1, because the memory has been free.

c. The 25. row: array2 is a pointer, it save a value, which is the address of array. so array2 = 321 means change this
value to 321.
